            <p>We know teachers are under pressure — juggling standards, limited prep time, and the demand to make lessons meaningful and inclusive. That’s why we’re offering ready-to-use, immersive lesson plans that don’t add more to your plate — they enhance what you’re already teaching.</p>
            <p>These resources integrate African American history directly into your American History, Washington State History, and African American History units — not as a separate sidebar, but as a vital, woven thread throughout.</p>
            <p>By grounding lessons in real, local archives — many of them endangered — we’re helping students connect more deeply to history, identity, and place. It’s accurate. It’s engaging. And it’s built to support you in giving students the fuller story they deserve.</p>
