## Database Documentation

This section provides details about the database schema designed for the Remnant Project. It includes a handoff guide explaining how to implement or adapt the schema and a detailed explanation of the schema itself.

### Database Handoff Guide

#### Remnant Project: Handoff Guide - Using Your Database Schema

**Introduction: What is This Document For?**

You now have a detailed blueprint (the "schema") for the Remnant Project's database, along with an explanation of its structure and a visual diagram. This schema is the design for organizing all the digital information for your archive.

This handoff guide explains what comes next. It outlines:
1.  What kind of expertise is needed to turn this blueprint into a working database.
2.  How someone with that expertise would likely use the schema.
3.  Different ways the database could be built and accessed.
4.  How this schema can still be valuable even if you use simpler tools or existing archival software.

The goal is to help you understand the potential paths forward so you can find the right people or tools to bring the digital archive to life.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Who can set this up? - Finding the Right Expertise for Implementation**
---------------------------------------------------------

Turning the database schema (the blueprint) into a working system requires different skills depending on the approach you take. Here’s a breakdown based on the two main paths: Option A (building a custom database) and Option B (adapting the schema for existing tools).

**Option A: Expertise for Building a Custom Database from the Schema**

This path involves creating a new database directly based on the provided schema files. This gives you the most power and flexibility to match the Remnant Project's vision.

* **Who to Look For (Roles/Experience):**
    * **Database Administrator (DBA):** Specialized in designing, implementing, and managing databases efficiently and securely. Ideal for ensuring the database itself is robust.
    * **Backend Developer:** Focuses on building the server-side "engine" of applications, including interacting with databases like MySQL. They can implement the schema and build the systems to access the data.
    * **Full-Stack Developer:** Works on both the backend (database, server logic) and the frontend (what users see). Can handle implementing the database and building the user interface (website, admin tools).

* **Important Skills for Option A:**
    * **Strong Understanding of Relational Databases:** Knowing how tables connect and how to structure data efficiently.
    * **Proficiency in SQL:** The standard language needed to create, manage, and query the database.
    * **Experience with MySQL (or similar systems):** While the schema is written for MySQL, a skilled developer could adapt this relational design to another similar system (like PostgreSQL) if needed. Familiarity with the target system is key.
    * **Database Setup & Hosting:** Experience creating database instances, potentially using cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or other hosting environments.

* **What They Do:** These individuals can take the provided SQL file (the code blueprint) and use it directly to construct the database tables, fields, and relationships. They typically also build the necessary surrounding software (APIs, admin panels, websites) to interact with the database.

**Option B: Expertise for Adapting the Schema with Existing Tools**

This path involves using the schema as a guide when working with pre-existing archival software, content management systems, or even simpler tools like spreadsheets.

* **Who to Look For (Roles/Experience):**
    * **Digital Archivist / Collections Manager:** Professionals trained in archival standards and practices, often experienced with specific archival software (like Omeka, CollectiveAccess, ArchivesSpace, PastPerfect, etc.).
    * **Museum Technologist / Digital Asset Manager:** Roles focused on managing digital collections and the software used for them.
    * **Tech-Savvy Project Staff / Volunteers:** Individuals within your organization or community who are skilled at configuring software settings or managing complex spreadsheets.

* **Important Skills/Knowledge for Option B:**
    * **Familiarity with Specific Archival Software:** Deep knowledge of configuring the metadata fields and structures within the chosen platform is crucial.
    * **Understanding of Metadata Standards:** Knowledge of standards like Dublin Core (which inspired many fields in your schema) helps in mapping the schema's concepts to the tool's capabilities.
    * **Data Entry and Configuration:** Skills in setting up the fields and inputting data correctly within the chosen tool.
    * **Spreadsheet Proficiency (if applicable):** Advanced skills in spreadsheet software if that is the chosen starting tool.

* **What They Do:** These individuals use the provided schema documentation (the explanation document, the field lists) as a reference. They ensure that the chosen software or spreadsheet system is configured to capture the *types* of information identified as important in the schema (like creator, subject, description, relationships, media types), even if the underlying database structure of the tool is different. They adapt the schema's concepts to fit the constraints and features of their existing tools.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Option A: Custom Build - How Would They Implement the Full Schema?**
---------------------------------------------------------

Someone with the technical skills mentioned above would typically:

1.  **Set up a MySQL Database:** They would create an empty MySQL database instance. This might be done through:
    * **Cloud Hosting:** Using services like AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud, or Azure. These platforms offer managed database services (like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) which simplify setup and maintenance. This is a very common approach.
    * **Traditional Web Hosting:** Many web hosting providers offer MySQL databases as part of their packages.
    * **Dedicated Server:** Setting up MySQL on a server managed directly by your team or a provider.

2.  **Run the SQL Schema File:** They would execute the `.sql` file you provide. This file contains the commands (`CREATE TABLE...`) that instruct MySQL to build all the tables (`Users`, `Items`, `Media`, etc.) and their specific fields (`title`, `description`, `dc_creator`, etc.) exactly as designed.

3.  **Build Interfaces to Manage the Database:** A database itself is just for storing data. To make it useful, you need ways to add, edit, and view the information. This typically involves building:
    * An administrative interface (for managing the archive).
    * The connection to a public-facing website or application (for visitors to browse and interact with the archive).
    * Potentially an API (Application Programming Interface) - a way for other software or future applications (like VR experiences) to securely access the archive data.

**Benefits of this Approach:**
* **Full Feature Support:** This approach best supports the vision of a "living archive" with complex relationships, user contributions (comments, tags), curated collections, and potential future integrations.
* **Scalability:** Can be designed to handle large amounts of data and many users.

**Considerations:**
* Requires some specialized technical expertise (DBA, Backend/Full-Stack Developer).
* Requires development time to build the database *and* the interfaces (for the database admin tools).

---------------------------------------------------------
**Option B: Adaptation - How Can This Schema Be Used with Other Tools?**
---------------------------------------------------------

You might work with individuals or tools that don't involve building a completely custom database from scratch. For instance:

* **Working with Archivists & Archival Software:** You might collaborate with digital archivists or collections managers who use established archival software platforms (like Omeka, CollectiveAccess, ArchivesSpace, etc.).
    * **How the Schema Helps:** These platforms often have their *own* underlying database structures but usually allow significant customization of the *metadata fields* for describing items. Your schema provides a comprehensive list of *what* information is important to capture for the Remnant Project. An archivist can use your schema (especially the detailed `Items` table fields, including the Dublin Core `dc_` fields) as a reference or checklist to configure the fields within their chosen software. They can adapt the concepts (like having fields for `dc_subject`, `dc_creator`, `text_extraction`, etc.) to fit the capabilities of their tool.
    * **Limitations:** These tools might not easily replicate the *exact relational structure* (e.g., the specific `Item_Relationships` table or the flexibility of the `Media` table might work differently). However, the schema still provides invaluable guidance on the *types* of data to manage.
    * **Who Can Help:** Digital Archivists, Collections Managers, Museum Technologists – people experienced in using and configuring specific archival content management systems.

* **Using Simpler Tools (like Spreadsheets):** As a very basic starting point, or for managing a smaller subset of data, the schema can even inspire a structured spreadsheet system.
    * **How the Schema Helps:** You could create different spreadsheet tabs named after the core tables (`Items`, `Media`, `Categories`). The field names in the schema (`item_id`, `title`, `description`, etc.) can become the column headers in your spreadsheets. This ensures you are thinking about and collecting the right kinds of information from the start.
    * **Limitations:** Spreadsheets lack the power of a relational database. They don't automatically enforce relationships between tables, are harder to query in complex ways, less efficient for large datasets, and don't easily support features like user accounts or simultaneous editing without specialized services (like Google Sheets, Airtable). This approach would likely not support the full vision of an interactive, living archive.
    * **Who Can Help:** Tech-savvy project staff, volunteers comfortable with spreadsheet software.

**Benefits of Adaptation:**
* Potentially faster or less expensive to get started if using existing tools or skills.
* Leverages expertise focused on archival standards and practices (if working with archivists).

**Considerations:**
* May not fully replicate all features and relationships defined in the custom schema.
* Capabilities depend heavily on the chosen software or tool.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Making the Choice & Next Steps**
---------------------------------------------------------

The best path forward depends on the Remnant Project's specific goals, available resources (budget, technical expertise), and long-term vision.

* If the goal is a fully custom, interactive "living archive" with all the designed features, pursuing **Option A (Custom Build)** with a database/backend developer is likely necessary.
* If you plan to use existing archival software or need a simpler way to start organizing information, **Option B (Adaptation)** is viable, using the schema as a detailed guide for configuration or structure.

**Your Next Step:**
Discuss these options and your project vision with potential collaborators.
* If considering a custom build, share the schema, explanation document, and this guide with potential developers or database administrators.
* If considering using existing archival tools, share these documents with the archivists or managers who would configure that software. They can assess how well the schema's concepts can be mapped onto their chosen platform.

No matter which path you choose, this database schema provides a robust and thoughtful foundation for organizing the rich historical materials of the Remnant Project. It defines the essential information and relationships needed to build a valuable digital archive.

### Database Schema Explanation

#### Remnant Project: Understanding this Database Design

**Introduction: What is This Document?**

This document explains the design (called a "schema") for the digital database created for the Remnant Project. Think of this schema as the blueprint for organizing all the information about the historical documents and objects in your archive. It defines how the data will be stored, structured, and related, making it easy to manage, search, and use in the future.

We'll explain the basic concepts first, then walk through each part of the blueprint.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Part 1: Basic Concepts - What is it?**
---------------------------------------------------------

* **What is SQL?**
    SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to communicate with many databases. It's like the set of commands you use to ask the filing cabinet to "find this specific file," "add a new file," or "update information in an existing file."

* **What is MySQL?**
    MySQL is a specific, popular, and widely-used database software program. Think of it as a trusted brand or type of digital filing cabinet system. It's known for being reliable and efficient.

* **What is a "Relational" Database?**
    This is the *type* of database system we're using. Instead of storing everything in one giant list (like a single spreadsheet), a relational database breaks information down into sections. For example, we'll have one table for the main archive 'Items', another for related 'Media' files (like photos or scans), and another for 'Categories'. These tables are then linked or "related" to each other. For instance, we can link a specific photo from the 'Media' table directly to the 'Item' it depicts in the 'Items' table - and that way, for example, all of the 'Media' can be kept organized in the same way.

* **Why Use This Approach for the Remnant Project?**
    * **Organization:** It keeps different types of information separate but connected, making the archive logical and manageable.
    * **Efficiency:** Finding specific information or related pieces is much faster, when it is eventually displayed.
    * **Accuracy:** It reduces mistakes by storing information in only one place (e.g., an item's title is stored once in the 'Items' table, even if it has multiple photos linked to it).
    * **Flexibility:** The structure can always be expanded later if new types of information need to be stored. The structure doesn't have to be permanent.
    * **Compatibility:** Because SQL and MySQL are industry standards, many different software applications, websites, and developers can work with this database. This gives you options for how you build tools around the archive in the future - for example, it could eventually connect to be shown in a VR application made in Unity.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Part 2: Overview of Your Remnant Project Database Schema**
---------------------------------------------------------

This specific database design aims to:

1.  **Store Core Item Information:** Hold all the key details about each document or object in the archive.
2.  **Manage Media Files:** Keep track of associated digital files like scans, photos, videos, or audio recordings.
3.  **Organize and Categorize:** Allow items to be grouped by official categories and by user-contributed tags (so that the community can help shape and categorize the archive).
4.  **Enable Interaction:** Provide places for user comments and for linking related items together.
5.  **Support Curation:** Allow for the creation of special themed collections or exhibits.
6.  **Plan for the Future:** Include openings for detailed archival metadata (like Dublin Core), user accounts, and text that is scanned from documents, even if these are not implemented immediately.

The schema is composed of several tables, each designed to hold a specific kind of information. Let's look at each one.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Part 3: The Database Tables Explained**
---------------------------------------------------------

Below is a breakdown of each table in the database blueprint. Each table has "fields" (like columns in a spreadsheet) that define what specific pieces of information are stored for each entry.

**1. Table: Users**

* **Purpose:** Holds information for user accounts (like administrators who manage the archive, editors who add content, or viewers who just browse). This might not be needed right away, but it sets up the structure for managing access if you build a web interface later.

    * *(PRIMARY KEY (item_id, category_id))* This ensures that the exact same item/category pair cannot be linked twice.
        * *Benefit:* Prevents duplicate connections.

**6. Table: Tags**

* **Purpose:** Stores keywords or "tags" that can be associated with items. Unlike categories, tags might be more informal or added by the community ("folksonomy") to help with searching and discovery.
* **Fields:**
    * `tag_id`: A unique number automatically assigned to identify each tag. (Type: Number)
        * *Benefit:* Unique internal reference for each tag.
    * `name`: The tag word or phrase itself (e.g., "protest", "map", "family photo"). Must be unique. (Type: Text)
        * *Benefit:* The keyword used for tagging and searching.

**7. Table: Item_Tags (A "Join Table")**

* **Purpose:** Similar to `Item_Categories`, this table *links* items to tags. An item can have many tags, and a tag can be applied to many items.
* **Fields:**
    * `item_id`: The ID number of the item being tagged. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Points to the specific item.
    * `tag_id`: The ID number of the tag being applied. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Points to the specific tag.
    * *(PRIMARY KEY (item_id, tag_id))* Ensures the same item/tag pair isn't linked twice.
        * *Benefit:* Prevents duplicate tagging.

**8. Table: Comments**

* **Purpose:** Stores comments made by users about specific archive items. Can include text and/or an attached media file.
* **Fields:**
    * `comment_id`: A unique number automatically assigned to identify each comment. (Type: Number)

        * *Benefit:* Connects the comment to the relevant archive item.
    * `user_id`: Links the comment to the user who wrote it. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Identifies the author of the comment.
    * `comment_text`: The actual text of the comment. Can be empty if the comment is just media. (Type: Long Text)
        * *Benefit:* Holds the user's written feedback or information.
    * `media_id`: Optionally links to a media file (from the 'Media' table) submitted with the comment. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Allows users to add images, audio, etc., to illustrate their comments.
    * `created_at`: Automatically records when the comment was posted. (Type: Date/Time)
        * *Benefit:* Shows when the comment was made.

**9. Table: Item_Relationships**

* **Purpose:** Captures connections *between* two different items in the archive, as defined by users or curators. For example, linking a photo to a letter that describes the event in the photo.
* **Fields:**
    * `relationship_id`: A unique number automatically assigned to identify each relationship link. (Type: Number)
        * *Benefit:* Unique internal reference for each defined connection.
    * `item_id_a`: The ID of the first item in the relationship. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Identifies one of the connected items.
    * `item_id_b`: The ID of the second item in the relationship. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Identifies the other connected item.
    * `relationship_description`: Optional text explaining *how* the two items are related. (Type: Long Text)
        * *Benefit:* Provides context for the connection.
    * `media_id`: Optionally links to a media file that helps illustrate the relationship (e.g., an audio clip explaining the connection). (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Allows adding visual or audio context to the relationship link itself.
    * `created_at`: Automatically records when the relationship was defined. (Type: Date/Time)
        * *Benefit:* Tracks when connections between items are made.

**10. Table: Special_Collections**

* **Purpose:** Stores information about curated collections or exhibits that group specific items together, perhaps for a theme, event, or special presentation (like in a VR space or physical display).
* **Fields:**
    * `collection_id`: A unique number automatically assigned to identify each special collection. (Type: Number)
        * *Benefit:* Unique internal reference for each collection.
    * `title`: The name or title of the collection. Required. (Type: Text)

        * *Benefit:* Tracks when collections are defined.
    * `updated_at`: Automatically records the last time information about this collection was changed. (Type: Date/Time)
        * *Benefit:* Tracks updates to collection details.

**11. Table: Collection_Items (A "Join Table")**

* **Purpose:** Links items from the main 'Items' table to the 'Special_Collections' they belong to. Needed because a collection has many items, and one item might appear in multiple collections.
* **Fields:**
    * `collection_item_id`: A unique number automatically assigned to identify each link. (Type: Number)
        * *Benefit:* Unique internal reference for each item's inclusion in a collection.
    * `collection_id`: The ID of the special collection. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Points to the specific collection.
    * `item_id`: The ID of the item included in the collection. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Points to the specific item.

**12. Table: Collection_Media (A "Join Table")**

* **Purpose:** Links media files (from the 'Media' table) directly to a 'Special_Collection'. This is for media *about the collection itself* (like a banner image or introductory video), not media tied to individual items *within* the collection.
* **Fields:**
    * `collection_media_id`: A unique number automatically assigned to identify each link. (Type: Number)
        * *Benefit:* Unique internal reference for collection-specific media.
    * `collection_id`: The ID of the special collection. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Points to the specific collection.
    * `media_id`: The ID of the media file being linked to the collection. (Type: Number / Link)
        * *Benefit:* Points to the specific media file (which should typically not have an `item_id` set in the `Media` table).

**Part 4: How the Tables Connect (Relationships)**
---------------------------------------------------------

You'll notice fields like `item_id`, `user_id`, `category_id`, etc., appear in multiple tables. These act as *links* or "Foreign Keys".

* **Example:** The `item_id` field in the `Media` table connects a specific media record (like a photo) back to the corresponding item record in the `Items` table.
* **Join Tables:** Tables like `Item_Categories`, `Item_Tags`, `Collection_Items` exist solely to create connections when the relationship is "many-to-many" (one item can have many tags, one tag can apply to many items).

This system of linking tables is powerful because:
* It avoids repeating information (an item's title is stored only once).
* It ensures consistency (if you update an item's title, it's updated everywhere it's referenced).
* It allows you to ask complex questions (e.g., "Show me all photos related to items in the 'Civil Rights' category created between 1960 and 1970").
